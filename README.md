# NLP - Integration

Anonymous messages that users send may contain harmful content or bad words, which may affect the receiver's mental health. So I integrate an NLP solution to address this issue. 

### For Bad word detecting : 

To detect bad words I defined a list of bad words in Sinhala Singlish, and when users send messages, they check against the list to find any bad words in their texts. If any bad word exists it will show a warning and will now send to the target user

### For harmful content :

detecting harmful content in all 3 languages was challenged. I used 4 models to overcome this.
- 1 : model to detect Singlish harmful texts
- 2 : model to detect Sinhala harmful texts
- 3 : model to detect English harmful texts
- 4 : model to identify English and Sinhala separately

dataset:
- by scraping youtube comments using youtube v3 api
- by collecting comments via google form
